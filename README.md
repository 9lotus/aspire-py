## Introduction
Hi, if you are reading this then congratulations! You are beginning a journey to learning a whole lot about software development and AI engineering.
The following sections will help you build up fundamental knowledge on a variety of topics. The only assumptions going in are that you have written simple 
code before (conditonals and loops), and have a willingness to learn.

## How to use
Located in this repository, you will see directories (folders) titled `Project-N` which contain the lessons of each major topic. To begin working on a project, navigate/click to the directory. Each one will have its own README.md (which is what you are reading right now) that will detail the lesson goals of the project and
how to solve it. Start with `Project-0`. Good luck and always ask questions!

### Disclaimer
This is not meant to be done by a new student all on their own. I have written each lesson such that students will be able to do most by themselves, however, it is under the assumption that I, or any other knowledgeable software engineer is always there to help!
