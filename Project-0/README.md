## Assignment
Welcome to the first project! Here's how to complete it:
- ✅ Create a github account
- ✅ `Fork` the `aspire-py` repo into your account
- ✅ Get a `UNIX` based terminal on your computer
- ✅ `Clone` your `fork` of the `aspire-py` repo onto your `local machine`
- ✅ ALL using the command line:
    - Navigate to `aspire-py/Project-0` in the command line
    - Create a folder called `src`
    - Create a file inside `src` called `main.py`
    - Using `vim`, edit `main.py` to write a `hello world` program in python
- ✅ From the `top` level of `Project-0`, list all of the files and folders (even `nested`), along with the byte sizes and `permissions` of each using command line commands
    - Copy and paste that output to `main.py` in a `multiline comment`
- ✅ Using a `package manager`, install `cowsay` and `fortune`
    - On the command line, get a cow to say a fortune. Then copy and paste that output to `main.py` inside of a `multiline comment`
- ✅ Once you are done with everything, using the command line, stage/`add` your changes, `commit`, and then `push` to your repo so that Brian can see what you have done

### Do not panic!
This seems like a lot but I promise you will get it faster than you think! Any of the the `highlighted` words are things that I think may be a little tricky.

If you have any questions, go ask Brian for help or try searching it online! (yes that is always allowed)

## Goals
After completing this project, you should be able to have the following skills:
- Understand what version control is and why it is useful
- Understand why the command line is a powerful tool for programmers
- Basics of `vim` (muahahaha)
- Understand what package managers are and be able to replicate the `cow` above using code
- Do simple command line commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `|` and understand OS directory structure
    - Understand what a `flag` is and how to pair it with commands
- Do simple `git` commands such as `add`, `commit`, and `push`
