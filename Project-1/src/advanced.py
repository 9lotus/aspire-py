#TODO: For test1, figure out how to import your Avenger class from intermediate.py

"""
TEST 1
Now that you are familiar with classes, we are going to work with inheritance

Inheritance basically is a fancy way for our classes to relate to each other,
and in theory reduce the amount of code we need to write

We are going to implement a sub-class of the Avenger class we wrote in intermediate.py

Below, implement class, BlackPanther, which inherits from Avenger.

Make sure of these things:
- Make its own `init` function so that it gets instantiated correctly
    - This function should have all the same parameters as Avenger
- Use the `super` keyword to instantiate all the fields efficiently
    - DO NOT JUST COPY INIT FROM AVENGER

Additionally, lets have a special field just for T'Challa:
- vibranium: (boolean)    initialized to True
"""
class Avenger:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

class BlackPanther(Avenger):
    super().__init__("hi")

    """
    TEST 2

    Remember that function we made in `Avenger` that was not implemented?

    Often times we can make parents classes have unimplemented methods like this
    In python these are the closest things to **interfaces**

    Implement black panthers `special_power` method

    This function will maximize his agility and power stats to .99 at the cost of 
    depleting his health by 10

    NOTE: This is an example of an **override**
    """

    """
    TEST 3
    
    Lets dig a little more into overriding, this happens when we 
    implement a function of our parent and change the behavior of that function.
    Something to note is that generally for it to be an override, the function signature
    has to be the exact same. Otherwise it may be an **overload**
    Python is hardly a real programming language so these concepts are muddied
    and overloading doesnt really exist...

    Lets override the attacked() function for T'Challa
    If you can recall from the movies, Black Panthers super suit
    can take kinetic impacts and repel them out to attack his enemies

    To implement this behavior into attacked(), lets override it

    attacked should now behave as follows:
    - Keep all of the code from intermediate.py where we dice roll for an agility% chance
    - Now instead of only returning a bool for dead, return a tuple where the first element
      is a bool for whether he is dead, but the second is a float which will be 
      50% of the damage that T'Challa was dealt. We can use this information to 
      deal damage back to the attacker, thus simulating the kinetic properties of his suit
